# AVR Electronic Safe
This project is a digital safe that allows users to set a password permanently, lock and unlock the safe and reset the password, there is also a security mechanism that 
turns on an alarm if a wrong pass word was entered 3 times.

## ⚡Components
 The following components have been used:
 * ATMEGA32 MCU
 * Buzzer
 * 2*16 LCD
 * LED
 * Keypad
 * Servo motor

## 🛠️Drivers
In order to achive the project funtionality I wrote the following drivers:
* DIO
* Buzzer
* LCD
* LED
* Keypad
* EEPROM
* Servo
these drivers can be found in /src forlder

## 👨‍💻Simulation
The proteus simulation design can be found in (design.pdsprj) file, here is the simulation in action:
